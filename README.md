# Modelling-with-KNN_classifier_And-_Naive_Bayes-classifier
## problem statement:
**create a model that can predict survival rate in a ship taking into consideration factors sorrounding passengers aboard the Titanic.**
## Experimental design
* Loading and previewing the dataset
* Data cleaning,removing and replacing null values, checking for outliers
* Undertook exploratory data analysis, both bivariate, univariate and multivariate analysis to gain insights about the data
* Modelling with KNearest Neigbhbors and Multilinear Naice Bayes , including hyper parameter tunning 
## Challenging the solution
despite halving a model that can help in disaster management, still we do not have know the fine details on where the survivors or non-survivors were when the Titanic sunk.Furthermore, our analysis does not incorporate the safety measures available in the a ship, e.g safety jackets or rescue boats. 
## Did we have the right data? ## 
no, we do not know the causes of death of the non-survivors,could be due to extreme cold, drowning etc... We need additional data of those survived that can help to explain the non-survivors
